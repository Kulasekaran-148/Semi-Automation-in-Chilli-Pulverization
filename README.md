# Semi-Automation in Chilly Pulverization
This is my final year project. The goal of this was to reduce the workload of employees at small spice mills who use Plate mill machines. Dry chilies are fed into the hopper as input and ground into a fine powder. But to obtain the fineness in powder, this feeding and grinding operation is repeated three to four times. Our initiative aims to automate this refeeding component so that human workers won't have to exert themselves excessively throughout the day.
